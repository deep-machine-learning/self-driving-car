This Pathing / Pedestrian System was developed for our "Road & Traffic System" and we thought we would share it with the unity community.

You can find an introductory video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0BNOlTVxxU 

Also don't forget to check out the "Road & Traffic System" if you need more than just a pedestrian pathing system, for instance, 
if you want to build entire road networks (large or small) and have unlimited traffic running on them for all platforms including mobile!

The Road & Traffic System can be found here: http://u3d.as/9dw

We hope you enjoy this pathing / pedestrian package.
